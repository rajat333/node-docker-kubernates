docker images -a -q


Remove all images 
docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)

Forcefully deleting an images 
sudo docker rmi -f b3eff4581208 ( Image Id) 


#check container
docker ps -a

#remove container
docker rm containerID

#Run program inside docker using docker container id 

docker ps => list containing container id 

docker exec -it containerId (hd938u93cjbj)  sh( sheel program)
